<h2>Invocation</h2>
<p>Towards the One, The perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty, The Only Being,
United with all the Illuminated Souls who form the embodiment of the Master,
The Spirit of Guidance.
</p>

<h2>Saum</h2>
<p>Praise be to Thee,
Most Supreme God,
Omnipotent, Omnipresent,
All-pervading,
The Only Being.
</p>
<p>Take us in Thy Parental Arms,
Raise us from the denseness of the earth.
</p>
<p>Thy Beauty do we worship,
To Thee do we give willing surrender,
Most Merciful and Compassionate God,
The Idealized Lord of the whole humanity,
Thee only do we worship, and towards Thee alone we aspire.
</p>
<p>Open our hearts towards Thy Beauty,
Illuminate our souls with Divine Light.
</p>
<p>O Thou, the Perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty,
All-powerful Creator, Sustainer, Judge
and Forgiver of our shortcomings,
Lord God of the East and of the West,
of the worlds above and below,
And of the seen and unseen beings:
Pour upon us Thy Love and Thy Light,
Give sustenance to our bodies, hearts and souls,
Use us for the purpose that Thy Wisdom chooseth,
and guide us on the path of Thine Own Goodness.
</p>
<p>Draw us closer to Thee
every moment of our life,
Until in us be reflected
Thy Grace, Thy Glory, Thy Wisdom,
Thy Joy and Thy Peace.
</p>

<h2>Salat</h2>
<p>Most gracious Lord,
Master, Messiah, and Saviour of humanity,
We greet Thee in all humility.
Thou art the First Cause and the Last Effect,
the Divine Light and the Spirit of Guidance, Alpha and Omega.
</p>
<p>Thy Light is in all forms, Thy love in all beings:
in a loving mother, in a kind father,
in an innocent child, in a helpful friend,
and in an inspiring teacher.
</p>
<p>Allow us to recognize Thee in all Thy holy names and forms:
as Rama, as Krishna, as Shiva, as Buddha;
Let us know Thee as Abraham, as Solomon,
as Zarathushtra, as Moses, as Jesus, as Mohammed,
and in many other names and forms,
known and unknown to the world.
</p>
<p>We adore Thy Past,
Thy Presence deeply enlighteneth our being,
and we look for Thy Blessing in the future.
</p>
<p>O Messenger, Christ, Nabi, the Rasul of God,
Thou whose heart constantly reacheth upward,
Thou comest on earth with a message
as a dove from above when Dharma decayeth
and speakest the Word that is put into Thy mouth
as the light filleth the crescent moon.
</p>
<p>Let the Star of the Divine Light, shining in Thy heart,
be reflected in the hearts of Thy devotees.
</p>
<p>May the Message of God reach far and wide,
illuminating and making the whole humanity
as one single Brotherhood in the Fatherhood of God.
</p>


<h2>Khatum</h2>
<p>O Thou, who art the Perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty,
The Lord of heaven and earth,
Open our hearts, that we may hear Thy Voice,
which constantly cometh from within.
</p>
<p>Disclose to us Thy Divine Light,
which is hidden in our souls, that we may know
and understand life better.
</p>
<p>Most Merciful and Compassionate God,
give us Thy great Goodness,
Teach us Thy loving Forgiveness,
Raise us above the distinctions and differences which divide men,
Send us the Peace of Thy Divine Spirit,
And unite us all in Thy Perfect Being.
</p>
